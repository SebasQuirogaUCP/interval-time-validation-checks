# ⏳ Time Overlap Checker - Educational Project  

🚀 A React project for detecting **time range overlaps**, including tricky **cross-midnight scenarios**.  
📚 Designed for **educational purposes**, this project helps developers learn **time-based calculations** and **interval logic** in Typescript.

## 📌 What This Project Teaches  

✅ Understanding **time range overlap detection**  
✅ Handling edge cases for **midnight (`00:00`)**  
✅ Splitting time ranges that **extend past midnight**  

---

## 🛠 How It Works  

1️⃣ **Converts time strings (`HH:mm`)** into **total minutes since midnight**
2️⃣ **Handles special cases** where `00:00` (midnight) is the end of the day  
3️⃣ **Splits time windows that cross midnight** into two separate **day segments**  
4️⃣ **Checks for overlaps** across multiple segment combinations  
5️⃣ **Returns `true` if any overlap is found**

## 🔥 Why This Is Useful?
🎯 Avoid scheduling conflicts in time-based applications
🎯 Improve your logic skills with real-world use cases
🎯 Understand how to manipulate and compare time intervals
